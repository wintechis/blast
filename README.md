# BLAST - Block Applications For Things 
This project aims to provide an easy to use [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) Application to communicate with the Web of Things [WoT](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/).  

Check [./docs/](docs/) for detailed documentation.

## Usage
This code works out of the box. Just open the index.html file in your favorite Browser.

## Planned features
* **auto generate things blocks** - automatically generate `property`, `action`, and `event` blocks from its [things description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/)
* **storage** save and generate links to block programs
* **unit testing** add unit tests
  
For smaller planned improvements see [issues](https://github.com/wintechis/blast/issues)
