# BLAST - Block Applications For Things 
This project aims to provide an easy to use Blockly-interface for creating IoT-applications.  

The blocks provide capabilites to create simple querying applications or more complex ones that trigger state-dependent or event-based actions.

* **modules** - saving chunks of blocks and naming them for future-use
