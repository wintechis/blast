                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <img src="logo-blast.png" class="blast-logo">
                <ul>
                    <li>Connected devices have a wide variety of applications in the industry [1]</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of Things</a> (WoT) is a standard to
                        create applications for connected devices</li>
                    <li>The programming languages currently used to access the devices are primarily text-based and
                        difficult for casual users to utilize</li>
                    <li>To improve accessibility to WoT-based connected devices we introduce
                        <b>BLAST: A block-based visual programming editor and execution environment</b>

                    </li>
                </ul>



                <h3>2. BLAST Language</h3>
                The Language of our block-based visual programming language BLAST
                <ul>
                    <li>is a mixture of natural and computer language [2]</li>
                    <li>has standard elements such as loops, functions, and variables</li>
                    <li>includes WoT related blocks grouped under the three interaction affordances <i>properties</i>,
                        <i>actions</i>, and <i>events</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>consists of blocks for SPARQL queries and HTTP requests</li>
                    <li>contains a block for native JavaScript code</li>
                </ul>

                With all these features BLAST can accomplish various use cases. A simple first example of a BLAST
                program is depicted in Figure 1.

                    <figcaption style="font-size: 1.4vw;">Figure 1: Example BLAST program that implements a geofencing
                        scenario</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <ul>
                    <li>The example uses two IoT devices to implement a geofencing scenario:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A LED light with a BLE interface</li>
                            <li>A BLE Beacon</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Both devices expose properties that can be read and written (e.g. colour)</li>
                    <li>The program is implemented using an <i>event</i> pattern by defining <i>states</i> with
                        conditions</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>

                </figure>
                <ul>
                    <li>The BLAST editor is based on Google's Blockly library</li>
                    <li>BLAST generates and executes JavaScript based on the arrangement of used blocks</li>
                    <li>The interaction with devices is based on the Web Bluetooth API and the Web HID API</li>
                    <li>We created a WoT interface for eight IoT devices containing metadata and JavaScript code for
                        communication</li>
                    <li>Besides IoT devices, the BLAST system supports access to
                        <ul>
                            <li>a <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/">Web Speech API</a></li>
                            <li>HTTP requests using the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch API</a></li>
                            <li>Solid based on <a

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <h3>4. Usability Evaluation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire is used to evaluate the user-friendliness of
                        BLAST
                    </li>
                    <li>We conducted an evaluation with nine participants that had no prior knowledge of the system</li>
                    <li>Participants were asked to solve four tasks and then fill out the SUS questionnaires</li>
                    <li>BLAST achieved a SUS score of 81.4 out of 100 possible points (good usability)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
                <img src="contact.png" class="contact">
                <ul>
                    <li>We introduced BLAST, a block-based language and programming environment that simplifies the
                        interaction with IoT devices and
                        web
                        resources</li>
                    <li>We are currently working on an execution environment für BLAST programs independent of browsers
