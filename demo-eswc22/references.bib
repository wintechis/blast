  abstract = {Pedagogical algorithm visualization (AV) systems produce graphical representations that aim to assist learners in understanding the dynamic behavior of computer algorithms. In order to foster active learning, computer science educators have developed AV systems that empower learners to construct their own visualizations of algorithms under study. Notably, these systems support a similar development model in which coding an algorithm is temporally distinct from viewing and interacting with the resulting visualization. Given that they are known to have problems both with formulating syntactically correct code, and with understanding how code executes, novice learners would appear likely to benefit from a more “live” development model that narrows the gap between coding an algorithm and viewing its visualization. In order to explore this possibility, we have implemented “What You See Is What You Code,” an algorithm development and visualization model geared toward novices first learning to program under the imperative paradigm. In the model, the line of algorithm code currently being edited is reevaluated on every edit, leading to immediate syntactic feedback, along with immediate semantic feedback in the form of an AV. Analysis of usability and field studies involving introductory computer science students suggests that the immediacy of the model's feedback can help novices to quickly identify and correct programming errors, and ultimately to develop semantically correct code.}

  abstract = {Visual, block-based programming environments present an alternative way of teaching programming to novices and have proven successful in classrooms and informal learning settings. However, few studies have been able to attribute this success to specific features of the environment. In this study, we isolate the most fundamental feature of these environments, the block interface, and compare it directly to its textual counterpart. We present analysis from a study of two groups of novice programmers, one assigned to each interface, as they completed a simple programming activity. We found that while the interface did not seem to affect users' attitudes or perceived difficulty, students using the block interface spent less time off task and completed more of the activity's goals in less time.},

This article presents a taxonomy of languages and environments designed to make programming more accessible to novice programmers of all ages. The systems are organized by their primary goal, either to teach programming or to use programming to empower their users, and then, by each system's authors' approach, to making learning to program easier for novice programmers. The article explains all categories in the taxonomy, provides a brief description of the systems in each category, and suggests some avenues for future work in novice programming environments and languages.},
