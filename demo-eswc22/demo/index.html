            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                On this website, we demonstrate BLAST, a block-based software tool to create applications that interact
                with
                IoT
                devices, REST APIs, and much more. We prepared five Use Cases that utilize different aspects and
                features
                of
                BLAST. Each Use Case contains a textual description, an image of the BLAST program, and a video
                demonstration.

            <h3>Use Case 1: Switching a Signal Light</h3>

            <p>
                The first use case implements a switch for a signal light. The switching device is an Elgato Stream Deck
                with multiple buttons, colored in red, yellow, and green.
                Pressing a button turns on the corresponding color of the signal light.
                The BLAST code that realizes this behavior can be seen in the Figure below.
            </p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img class="blastCode" style="width: 37%" src="./img/usecase1_BLAST.png">
                <figcaption class="center"><br>Figure 1: BLAST program switching a signal light
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the first part of the program, the desired colors are assigned to the buttons of the stream deck.
                Then
                three events are defined, which specify the behavior when a button is pressed. When an event is
                triggered, the program writes the
                respective color of the button to the BLE LED controller and changes the color of the active light. <br>
                The video below demonstrates this process.

            <h3>Use Case 2: Coffee Temperature Monitoring </h3>

            <p>
                The second use case uses a BLE beacon with an integrated temperature sensor to monitor the temperature
                of the coffee. As soon as the temperature drops below 55 degrees, the coffee is drinkable and the user
                is
                notified by a green WebHID light.

                This BLAST program is based on events. For this a state is defined by a boolean expression. As soon as

                expression evaluates to true, blast enters the state and executes the corresponding code.

            <h3>Use Case 3: Movement Detection and Anti-Theft Alarm</h3>
            <p>
                In Use Case 3 we demonstrate how a simple Anti-Theft Alarm can be implemented using a RuuviTag and
                BLAST. To
                do so, the BLAST program continuously reads the integrated movement counter of the RuuviTag via
                Bluetooth. A
                change of the movement counter value triggers an event and a predefined sound that is loaded from a URI
                is
                played. The program can be seen below.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img class="blastCode" src="./img/usecase3-BLAST.png">
                <figcaption class="center">Figure 3: BLAST program monitoring the movement of a RuuviTag and sound

            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>
                The integrated movement detection of the RuuviTag can detect motion alongside different axis and
                automatically increases the movement counter. The RuuviTag
                broadcasts updates at a regular interval of 10 seconds to the BLAST program, thus the maximal delay
                between
                movement and alarm sound is 10 seconds.

            <h3>Use Case 4: Interaction with a REST API via Speech Input</h3>
            <p>
                Use Case 4 illustrates the usage of the included Speech-API and the interaction with a simple RESTful
                geolocation API. The user is asked to say the name of a well-known city, the Speech-API transforms the
                input
                to text and sends an HTTP GET request to a REST API which returns different information such as the
                latitude
                and longitude of the selected city.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since there is no block to transform the received JSON object to simple datatypes known in BLAST we make
                use
                of the custom JavaScript function block, where we can provide our JavaScript code.
                With this block, we create a function called "json2list" to transform the received JSON into a
                two-dimensional list and use for-loops to
                iterate over it. <br>
                In the following video, we look up three cities, namely Rome, Munich, and New York and display the
                coordinates in the action block output on the right-hand side.

            <h3>Use Case 5: Exchanging Data using SOLID Pods</h3>
            <p>
                In the final Use Case, we use two instances of BLAST, the first one interacts with a Xiaomi Mija
                Thermometer and uploads the received humidity values to a SOLID Pod.
                The second one retrieves the data from the Pod and changes the color of the WebHID light
                depending on the received values. <br> If the humidity is below 65 percent, the light turns green.
                However, if the humidity is above 65 percent, the light turns red informing
                the user that the humidity is too high.

                The interaction with the SOLID Pod is realized with HTTP GET and PUT requests. Authentication is not
                required to access the Pod. <br>
                The video shows instance 1 on top of instance 2. As soon as the humidity changes, the new values get
                transmitted via Bluetooth to instance 1 and uploaded to the SOLID Pod.
                Instance 2 sends every second an HTTP GET request to the Pod, prints the current value, and changes the
                HID light accordingly.
