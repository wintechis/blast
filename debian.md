# BLAST on Debian

Debian Bookworm

## Yarn

### With Debian yarnpkg

````
# apt-get install yarnpkg node
````

````
$ yarnpkg set version stable
````

### With "official" yarn

````
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
apt update
apt install yarn
````

## Install

Whether you use yarnpkg or yarn does not seem to make much of a difference.

When using yarnpkg, you have to change the engines in packages.json from yarn to yarnpkg (or just remove the entry).

Now, 

````
$ yarnpkg install
````

should work now, but I get:

````
➤ YN0009: │ usocket@npm:0.3.0 couldn't be built successfully (exit code 1, logs can be found here: /tmp/xfs-790c7a4f/build.log)
➤ YN0009: │ blast@workspace:. couldn't be built successfully (exit code 1, logs can be found here: /tmp/xfs-c6d0a255/build.log)
````

How can I check (without a device) whether BLAST has been built correctly?  Start the server!

Looks like the git repository contains autogenerated files that really should not be in the repository.

Is .yarnrc.yml  still needed?

What about .pnp.cjs?

In /package.json, are eslint et al. dev dependencies or dependencies?

Is 'yarnpkg build' (as in the README.md) still needed?  Looks like just
````
$ yarnpkg
````
does the install and build.
